    "\"Interval arithmetic is a mathematical technique used to put bounds on rounding errors and measurement errors in mathematical computation.  Instead of representing a value as a single number, interval arithmetic represents each value as a range of possibilities.  For example, instead of estimating the height of someone as exactly 2.0 metres, using interval arithmetic one might be certain that that person is somewhere between 1.97 and 2.03 metres.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mathematically, instead of working with an uncertain real $x$, one works with the ends of an interval $[a,b]$ that contains $x$.  In interval arithmetic, any variable $x$ lies in the closed interval between $a$ and $b$.  A function $f$, when applied to $x$, yields an uncertain result; $f(x)$ produces an interval $[c,d]$ which includes all the possible values for $f(x)$ for all $x\\in [a,b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Interval arithmetic is suitable for a variety of purposes. The most common use is in software, to keep track of rounding errors in calculations and of uncertainties in the knowledge of the exact values of physical and technical parameters. The latter often arise from measurement errors and tolerances for components or due to limits on computational accuracy.\""
